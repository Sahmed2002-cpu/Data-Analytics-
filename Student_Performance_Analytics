## Dataset
- Anonymized dataset of student exam scores, attendance records, and demographic data.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Extracted data from student records, including exam scores and attendance data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, normalized data, and prepared it for analysis.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Correlated student attendance with exam performance.
   - Analyzed the impact of demographic factors on performance.
4. **Visualization**: Created dashboards in Tableau to visualize performance by department and identify trends.

## Results
- The analysis showed that students with an attendance rate of over 85% performed 20% better in exams on average.
- Certain departments had higher performance disparities, which were addressed by targeted academic interventions.
