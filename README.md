# Research Data Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze research output data at Imperial College, focusing on publication trends, collaboration networks, and identifying high-impact research areas.

## Skills Used
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- SQL
- Tableau / Power BI for visualization

## Dataset
- Internal dataset containing details of research papers and collaboration metrics (due to confidentiality, dataset is not included).

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Extracted research data from Imperial Collegeâ€™s research repository.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data, standardized researcher names, and removed duplicates.
3. **Analysis**:
   - Performed an analysis of publication frequency over time.
   - Mapped collaboration networks to identify key researchers and departments.
   - Analyzed the impact of research collaborations.
4. **Visualization**: Used Python and Tableau to create visualizations of the collaboration network and research trends.

## Results
- The analysis revealed that 20% of publications resulted from international collaborations.
- Interdisciplinary research grew by 15% in the last three years, indicating increased collaboration between departments.
  
## Conclusion
The results were used to guide decisions on research funding and collaboration strategies.
